## Reflection Questions

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by focusing on user intent and value rather than just technical requirements. User stories help by framing features from the user’s perspective and clearly defining what the user wants and why. This structure reduces ambiguity, keeps development user-focused, and makes it easier to translate requirements into testable functionality.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach development iteratively, delivering small, functional increments and refining requirements as feedback is received and the project progresses. I plan to continue growing my Agile knowledge and skills, especcially with writing useful user stories, facilitating useful planning sessions, and refinements with my current team. These processes support adaptability, transparency, and higher-quality outcomes.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating across with all roles on the team, and taking shared ownership of the product. It involves asking questions early, giving and receiving feedback, and supporting the team’s ability to adapt and deliver value together.
